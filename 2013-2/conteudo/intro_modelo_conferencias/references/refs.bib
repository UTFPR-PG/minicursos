  abstract = {Networked or stand-alone computational environments that are available
	as free or open-source software are very useful for teaching engineering
	courses. The cost of implementation of these environments is essentially
	that of the underlying personal computer (PC) hardware. The necessary
	software, of very high quality, is available free of charge through
	the Internet. Our purpose is to show that free or open source software
	can be used as a good alternative for engineering students. The main
	focus is on Scilab, a numerical software package. Often installed
	on machines running the Linux operating system, it is a powerful
	tool that is useful in teaching numerical methods or computationally
	intensive disciplines. Also, presented are other free software packages,
	GSL (GNU Scientific Library) and LaTeX, that can be useful to the
	student. A package like Scilab can serve the needs of students when
	standard commercial mathematical software is not available.},
